						<h3>What is Project Themis?</h3>
						<p>Project Themis is a student-run organisation looking to eliminate all bias in the hiring process of companies.</p>
						<hr />
						<h3>What are we building?</h3>
						<p>We are building an AI that can sort through resumes and find which ones are better, using factors such as job experience and education while ignoring irrelevant factors, such that the best candidate will be chosen without bias. Once a human has chosen their idea of the best candidates, the two lists will be compared and we can flag them if there is clear bias or allow the interviews to proceed as normal.</p>
						<h3>How are we making an impact?</h3>
						<p>There are many gaps in the equality of hiring right now. The current solution is policies that demand an equal representation of certain genders and races in a company. While this seems good on paper it is actually very hurtful for the employees. If you think you only got into the company because of a quota or just because you are a minority, you will feel imposter syndrome. Other employees thinking the same thing about you may not want to cooperate with you as they may believe that you do not deserve the job. This causes a drop in productivity for companies and less well-being among employees. Using Project Themis, these problems will be eliminated as if you get into a company, you know that it is solely based on your skill level.</p>
						<h3>What do we want to accomplish?</h3>
						<p>We are creating an AI that can efficiently sort through resumes and rank them based solely on relevant skills and experience for the specific job. We hope that this will be implemented as an intermediate step in almost every business hiring process, and to be able to mitigate any bias that could be found in the process.</p>
